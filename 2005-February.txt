Subject: [Hpgs-devel] hpgs-0.5.1 including doxygen docu ist out.
Message-ID: <200502070944.31360.wolfgang.glas@ev-i.at>

Hi all,

   After the inclusion of PCL images in hpgs-0.5.0, I took the chance and 
worked out a brand new doxygen-documentation for hpgs-0.5.1, which can also 
be accessed through the documentation link at http://hpgs.berlios.de
